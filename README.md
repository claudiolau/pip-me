# PIP-ME

Template for fast-api using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)

## Getting started

```bash
brew install cookiecutter
```

```bash
{
 "directory_name": "xxx",
 "file_name": "__xxx__",
 "greeting_recipient": "xxx"
 ...
}

```

Cookiecutter takes a source directory tree and copies it into your new project. It replaces all the names that it finds surrounded by templating tags {{ and }} with names that it finds in the file cookiecutter.json. Thatâ€™s basically it.

Declaring json body to insert variable to auto-generate another template repository.

```bash

```
